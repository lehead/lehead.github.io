   <p>Relationships today are as diverse as the people in them. No longer does one size fit all, instead, we build our relationships from the ground up, based on the individual values, goals, and desires of partners. Modern relationships are fluid, they experiment with gender, sexuality, power, monogamy and nonmonogamy, attractions and desires, and much more. Louise is a relationship coach who helps people find sustainable solutions to these modern relationship challenges. She has been featured in Harper's Bazaar, Bustle, Essence, and Modern Fertility and writes about sex and relationships of all forms. Louise has a Bachelor’s degree from Tufts University and a Master’s degree in Marriage and Family Therapy from the California School of Professional Psychology.</p>
