   <p>Relationships today are as diverse as the people in them. No longer does one size fit all. Instead, we build our relationships from the ground up, based on the individual values, goals, and desires of partners. Louise is a relationship and personal coach who helps people find sustainable solutions to modern relationship challenges such as practicing equitable and open communication, recovering from infidelity, navigating queer and non-monogamous relationships, cultivating higher sexual satisfaction, addressing power differentials between partners, and more. Louise also works with individuals who need help reconnecting with their sense of purpose.
