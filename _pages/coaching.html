  <h2>How Coaching Works</h2>
  <h4>What to expect</h4>

   <p>Clients work with Louise from the comfort of their own homes.
     All individual and relationship sessions are conducted
     through a secure and
     confidential online video-platform that ensures all coaching
     conversations are private.

     <br> </br>
     Finding the right professional to guide you through
     life's challenges can be difficult. It's important to find someone
     who you feel
     connected and comfortable with! That's why before committing to any work
     with Louise, you will have a free consultation call so that you can evaluate
     if Louise's coaching is a good fit for you.
     All of Louise's coaching programs are 12 sessions long. Clients pay for each session
     separately at the time of the session and may cancel their remaining sessions at anytime.
   </p>

<h2>Individual Coaching</h2>
<h4>Reconnect with your purpose</h4>
<p>

All of us face periods in life when challenges or unhelpful
patterns of thinking and behavior prevent us from living a day-to-day
life that feels meaningful.
Often we find ourselves feeling fatigued, burnt-out, and passionless
without a plan for how to rekindle our spark for life.


  <br> </br>

Over the course of 12 video-chat meetings, Louise will teach you to make choices, small or large, that are guided
by your core values, your goals,
and your most cherished interpersonal relationships.
This skill frees you from making decisions based on feelings of guilt,
stress, obligation, or expectations that aren't in line with your
 personal ethic.
 <!-- Louise will help you to identify
the negative stories that you believe about yourself that are holding you back
from personal and professional growth. Together, you will build new personal
 narratives based on your strengths, values, and unique skill sets that will
  set you up to achieve your goals. -->

<h2>Relationship Coaching</h2>
<h4>Reconnect with each other</h4>
<p>
  Relationships today are as diverse as the people in them. No longer does one size fit all.
  Instead, we build our relationships from the ground up, based on the individual values, goals,
   and desires of partners. Louise helps people find
   sustainable solutions to modern relationship challenges such as practicing equitable and
   open communication, recovering from infidelity, navigating queer and non-monogamous relationships,
   cultivating higher sexual satisfaction, addressing power differentials between partners, and more.
<br> </br>

 Over the course of 12 video-chat meetings, Louise will help you to identify the biggest recurring
 obstacles in your relationship, understand your joint conflict cycle, and build a shared
 foundational relationship culture that will help you navigate old tensions that are holding
 you back from connection.
